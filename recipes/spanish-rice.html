   <p>My take on Spanish rice. Smoky, earthy, and tender without being fluffy.<p>
    <br>
   </p>Carlos O'Kelly's had my favorite take on Spanish rice. I spent years trying to find the recipe.<br>Everything I found online that looked close invariably disappointed me.<br>After numerous attempts, I finally came up with this. It's not quite the same, but close enough for me.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>1 cup Jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1.5 Tbsp chicken base (I use Better Than Boullion)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp smoked SPanish paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Ancho chile powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1.75 cups water</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <h3>Directions:</h3>
   <ol>
        <li>Heat butter in medium saucepan on medium heat until it begins to foam.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and rice. Stir until rice is well coated.</li>
        <li>Continue to stir until rice is fragrant and turns light brown</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste and stir allowing it to cook for a minute or so.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Add the chicken base and continue to stir for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat back up to medium high and add the spices and a splash of the water. Stir until incorporated. Add the remaining water and stir well</li>
        <li>Once it's close to boiling, reduce heat to low and cover. Cook for 12 minutes or until all the water has been absorbed.</li>
   </ol>
