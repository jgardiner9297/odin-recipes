    <p>A dead-simple recipe that's very tasty.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I came up with this one for my daughters. It's literally three ingredients and makes enough for several meals.<br> It can be made in a slow cooker, traditional stovetop, or Instant Pot. This version is stovetop, so adjust accordingly.</p>
